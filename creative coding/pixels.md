* To implement these pixel designs, here are detailed approaches and pseudocode examples:

  1. **Irregular Pixel Grid**
     Use the `noise()` and `random()` functions to create a grid that doesn't align to a standard square layout. Sample pixels from a video or image, and use `map()` to adjust the values for positioning shapes like squares, circles, triangles, diamonds, or custom polygons.

     ```javascript
     function draw() {
       for (let x = 0; x < width; x += stepSize) {
         for (let y = 0; y < height; y += stepSize) {
           let size = map(noise(x, y), 0, 1, minSize, maxSize);
           drawShape(x, y, size); // Custom function to draw shapes
         }
       }
     }
     ```

  2. **Interactive Pixels**:
     Capture the `mouseX` and `mouseY` to change properties of pixels at the cursor's location. You can adjust size, color, brightness, or substitute pixels with other content, such as images. Use mouse events to trigger these changes.

     ```javascript
     function draw() {
       let pixelColor = get(mouseX, mouseY);
       // Change color or size based on interaction
       fill(modifiedColor); // Modify the color based on some interaction logic
       rect(mouseX, mouseY, modifiedSize, modifiedSize); // Draw a rectangle with modified size
     }
     ```

  3. **Textured Pixels**:
     Instead of filling pixels with solid colors, use textures by loading images or creating patterns. Map these textures onto pixels or pixel groups to give the appearance of a textured surface.

     ```javascript
     let textureImg; // Assume this is loaded in setup()
     
     function draw() {
       for (let x = 0; x < width; x += pixelSize) {
         for (let y = 0; y < height; y += pixelSize) {
           // Use parts of the texture image to fill pixels
           image(textureImg, x, y, pixelSize, pixelSize, textureX, textureY, textureWidth, textureHeight);
         }
       }
     }
     ```
