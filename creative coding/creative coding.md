### Project Proposal Draft

**Working Title:** "Echoes of Nature"

**One Sentence Summary:** "Echoes of Nature" is an interactive installation that immerses participants in the sounds and sights of endangered ecosystems, aiming to foster a deeper connection with nature and awareness of environmental issues.

**Short Description:** This project leverages real-time environmental data to generate dynamic audiovisual landscapes, representing various endangered ecosystems around the world. By interacting with the installation, users can explore different habitats, understand their importance, and learn about the threats they face. The project combines gesture recognition and sound manipulation to allow users to interact naturally with the installation, creating an immersive experience that blurs the lines between technology and nature.

**Interest Origin:** My interest in this idea sparked from a documentary on climate change, highlighting the rapid loss of biodiversity. This, coupled with my fascination for interactive art and technology's potential to evoke empathy, led me to conceive this project. I aim to create an experience that not only educates but also emotionally connects users to environmental issues, inspiring action towards conservation.

**Visual References:**
- Sketches of the interactive installation layout and user interaction scenarios.
- Photos and videos of endangered ecosystems to be featured in the project.
- Inspirational interactive art installations that blend technology and nature.

**Rough Sketch of Design/Installation:** [Include a simple sketch that outlines the installation's design, including user interaction points, screens or projection areas, and sensor placement.]

**Input and Output:**
- **Input:** User gestures (e.g., hand movements, walking patterns) detected through motion sensors and cameras.
- **Output:** Real-time generated audiovisual representations of ecosystems that react to user interactions, displayed on large screens or through projections.

**Interaction:** The installation recognizes specific user gestures, translating them into interactions within the digital ecosystem. For example, waving hands might simulate wind in a forest, affecting the audiovisual output. This interaction aims to be intuitive, allowing users to naturally engage with the digital environment.

**Technology and Tools:**

- Programming Languages: Python for data processing, JavaScript with p5.js for frontend interaction.
- Gesture Recognition: Using Kinect or similar motion sensors.
- Sound Manipulation: Max/MSP for dynamic audio generation.
- Data Source: APIs for real-time environmental data.

**Aimed Feelings:** We aim to elicit feelings of wonder, connectedness, and concern for the natural world, encouraging participants to reflect on their relationship with the environment and the impact of human activity on ecosystems.

**Challenges and Assistance:** The integration of real-time environmental data and its translation into a compelling audiovisual experience presents a technical challenge. Additionally, designing intuitive and meaningful interactions will require careful consideration. I anticipate needing assistance with advanced data visualization techniques and effective use of gesture recognition technology.

### Conclusion

This proposal outlines a clear vision for "Echoes of Nature," an interactive installation designed to bridge the gap between technology and environmental awareness. By leveraging user interaction and real-time data, the project aims to create a powerful experience that highlights the beauty and fragility of our natural world, fostering a deeper connection and sense of responsibility towards its preservation.
